    <h1>Odo Sticky Headers</h1>
    <p>A mananger for sticky things</p>
    <h3>Support</h3>
    <p>IE9+</p>
    <h3>Dependencies</h3>
    <p>Odo Scroll Animation, Odo Window Events. ES6 <code>Map</code> and <code>Array.from</code>.</p>

    <h3>Setup</h3>
    <p>Create an instance of <code>OdoStickyHeaders</code> to manage each sticky item. Add your stickies to the manager with <code>add</code>.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">let stickyMananger = new OdoStickyHeaders();
let stickies = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.my-sticky'));
stickyMananger.add(stickies);</code></pre>

    <h2>Public Methods &amp; Properties</h2>
    <h3>add(elements)</h3>
    <p>Track an element to be sticky. <code>add</code> takes an element or array of elements.</p>

    <h3>mode</h3>
    <p>Set the mode to either push headers (<code>OdoStickyHeaders.Mode.PUSH</code>, which is the default) or to stack them on top of each other (<code>OdoStickyHeaders.Mode.STACK</code>).</p>

    <h3>remove(element)</h3>
    <p>Remove a sticky item instance by its element from the mananger.</p>

    <h3>update()</h3>
    <p>Update offsets and recalculate where each sticky should be. Use this when offsets on the page (e.g. the position of a sticky header) changes due to something other than a window resize.</p>

    <h3>recalculate()</h3>
    <p>Recalculate values without getting new offsets.</p>

    <h3>dispose()</h3>
    <p>Remove all sticky elements and event listeners.</p>

    <h3>stickyHolder = element</h3>
    <p>Set the location of sticky elements to be place in the DOM. <code>element</code> is the element which sticky items will be appended to when they are "fixed".</p>

    <h3>uiOverlap = function():number</h3>
    <p>Define a custom getter to determine overlap. The amount that the ui overlaps the top of the page. A sticky navigation, for example, would cause an overlap equal to its height. This value is used to determine when sticky items should become sticky, basically changing where the top of the viewport is.</p>

    <h3>uiOffset = function():number</h3>
    <p>Define a custom getter to determine offset. Where to start positioning new sticky items (setting their <code>top</code> while they're "fixed"). By default it's the same as the ui overlap, but can be customized.</p>
    <p>For example, if you have a sticky navigation which hides itself when the user scrolls, you should specify a UI offset which returns <code>0</code>. If your sticky elements are placed inside the sticky nav which is now off the screen, you will want to provide a UI offset getter function so that it's not <code>0</code>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container space-bottom">
    <h2>Demo</h2>
    <h3>Sticky Holder and UI Overlap</h3>
    <p>There is a hidden sticky nav on this page. Click this button to show it and make it the sticky element holder.</p>
    <button id="set-sticky-holder">Click me</button>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">setStickyHolderBtn.addEventListener('click', function () {
  // Show the sticky nav.
  stickyNav.style.display = '';

  // Tell OdoStickyHeaders to put elements inside the sticky nav when they're "fixed".
  stickyMananger.stickyHolder = stickyNavInner;

  // Set the UI overlap to the size of the sticky nav.
  stickyMananger.uiOverlap = function () {
    return stickyNav.offsetHeight;
  };

  // Showing the sticky nav caused elements on the page to move.
  stickyMananger.update();
});</code></pre>

    <p>Hide the sticky nav and unset it as the sticky holder.</p>
    <button id="unset-sticky-holder" disabled>Click me</button>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">unsetStickyHolderBtn.addEventListener('click', function () {
  // Hide sticky nav.
  stickyNav.style.display = 'none';

  // Leave sticky elements where they are when they're "fixed".
  stickyMananger.stickyHolder = null;

  stickyMananger.uiOverlap = function () {
    return 0;
  };

  // Offsets changed.
  stickyMananger.update();
});</code></pre>

    <h3>Change the mode</h3>
    <p>The secondary mode for OdoStickyHeaders is to stack each header.</p>
    <button id="set-mode-push" disabled>Push</button>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">setModePushBtn.addEventListener('click', function () {
  stickyMananger.mode = OdoStickyHeaders.Mode.PUSH;
  stickyMananger.update();
});</code></pre>
    <button id="set-mode-stack">Stack</button>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">setModeStackBtn.addEventListener('click', function () {
  stickyMananger.mode = OdoStickyHeaders.Mode.STACK;
  stickyMananger.update();
});</code></pre>
